Please describe the attached image in full details thoroughly and naturally, with a description of each object in the image.
Include Mermaid code or Markdown tables **only when** the image requires them.  
Keep the prose fluid and avoid listing this prompt’s questions or numbers.
Try to provide the information corresponding to the following points:

1. What information does this image convey? 
2. If this image is a natural image (people, scenery, city landscape, offices, etc..), describe all the objects in that image, and describe the background and setting of the image. 
3. If this image is an organization chart, a flowchart, a process chart, or any chart that conveys relationships and progress in timeline or execution, please generate the text description of this chart as accurately as possible, as well as generate the Mermaid code to capture the full information in the chart. As an accurate and faithful assistant, you **MUST** be able to capture all the information in the chart. When generating Mermaid code, do not generate paranthesis in the node names inside the code, because it might throw an error. 
4. If this image is an image of a numerical chart, like a line chart or a bar chart or a pie chart, generate a Markdown table that accurately represents the quantities being displayed. Describe in text the axes labels, the trend lines, the exact amounts, and so on and so forth. Be very descriptive when it comes to the numerical quantities: e.g. "the sales in May 2022 was $4.2 million", or "the market share of the X product is 22%", etc.. If this is a line chart, make sure that the values in the chart are aligned with the labels on the axes (X and Y are correct vs axes). You **MUST** output a Markdown representation of the data in a Markdown codeblock delimited by '```markdown' and '```'. The numbers **must absolutely** be accurate. After extracing the data, double check your results to make sure that the Markdown table is accurate and representative of the data in the image.
5. For all other cases, describe what's in the image as elaborately and as detailed as possible. 
6. If the image is that of a table, try to describe the table in full details, with a description of each column and row in the table. For each column, describe the header name, the data type and the purpose of the data and the column. If the table is a numerical table, try to describe the purpose and the trends of the different columns and rows in that table. In addition to that, output the table in Markdown format to be able to represent it in text. If the table is not clearly labeled, give the table a unique Title, based on the context supplied and the purpose of the table. If there are more than one table in the image, then describe each table separately. Please output the Markdown in a Markdown codeblock delimited by '```markdown' and '```'.
7. Try to guess the purpose of why the authors have included this image in the document.
8. If the attached is a screenshot of a document page with multiple images in it, then you **MUST* repeat the above steps per image and generate it all in the same output. 
9. If any point in the above is not applicable, you do **NOT** have to say "Not applicable" or "Not applicable as this is not ...", you can just skip that point. No need for needless text or explanations to be generated.
