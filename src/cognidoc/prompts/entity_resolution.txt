You are an entity resolution expert. Determine if two entity mentions refer to the same real-world entity.

ENTITY A:
- Name: {name_a}
- Type: {type_a}
- Description: {desc_a}
- Relationships: {relations_a}

ENTITY B:
- Name: {name_b}
- Type: {type_b}
- Description: {desc_b}
- Relationships: {relations_b}

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
1. Name variations: Consider abbreviations (ML = Machine Learning), translations across languages, synonyms, and alternative spellings
2. Types: Different types usually mean different entities, but not always (e.g., "Python" could be LANGUAGE or TOOL)
3. Descriptions: Should be compatible or complementary, not contradictory
4. Relationships: Shared relationships or relationship targets strongly suggest the same entity
5. Context: Use relationship context to disambiguate ambiguous names (e.g., "Python" the language vs "Python" the snake)

DECISION CRITERIA:
- SAME if: Names are variations of each other AND types are compatible AND descriptions/relationships don't contradict
- DIFFERENT if: Types are fundamentally incompatible OR descriptions clearly contradict OR context suggests different entities

OUTPUT (JSON only, no markdown):
{{
  "same_entity": true or false,
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "canonical_name": "Best name to use (most complete, standard, or widely recognized form)",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation in 1-2 sentences"
}}
